**Website Fixes**

*Steps:*
	1. Cloned the repository with the command git clone https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18
	2. git remote add dayo2 https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s18/aea405-weekly 
	3. Edited the markdown file and included the word "are". 
	4. git add *
	5. git commit -m "corrected grammatical issue"
	6. Here I got an error stating that DS_Store was an untracked file so I added it to the .gitignore file 
	7. git push dayo2 
	8. git checkout gh-pages
	9. git push origin gh-pages
	10. Created a [PR](https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18/pull/80)


*Code Triage*

I signed up for the following issues: 

	- [npm](https://www.codetriage.com/npm/npm)
	- [express](https://www.codetriage.com/expressjs/express)
	- [openfoodnetwork](https://www.codetriage.com/openfoodfoundation/openfoodnetwork)

**NPM**
This [issue](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/19477) was a little intimidating to look at. Working with the terminal is usually a hassle for me, so I chose npm to challenge myself, but it might be a little over my head. I don't really understand what the user is trying to achieve!

**Express**
This [issue](https://github.com/expressjs/express/pull/2702) seems a lot easier than the npm issue because it's a simple coding fix!

**OpenFoodNetwork**
This [issue](https://github.com/openfoodfoundation/openfoodnetwork/issues/1348) seems like a simple enough fix - it's only fixing a linking issue. It feels like something I could work on. There doesn't seem to be a 'starter' label on the issue though.
