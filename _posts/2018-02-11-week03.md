**Wikipedia Contributions**

To make a contribution to the Wikipedia database, I decided to make an edit to the SZA(singer) Wiki page for no particular reason other than the fact that I'm a huge fan. I wanted to contribute to something I was extremely familiar with/knowledgeable about, because I wanted to confidently make a contribution that's accurate.  

That being said, I decided to add 'James Fauntleroy' to the list of SZA's associate acts, because she featured him on her most recent album.
