NYU Open Data Week Recap:

I attended the **NYC Open Data Week @ NYU** on March 5th. The event was  illuminating because it initiated conversations on the  importance and significance of 'big data' that I had yet to consider. The panelists, including Dominic Mauro, Vicky Steeves, and Dinorah Cantu-Pedraza, spoke about the use of data, through their various professional perspectives. One topic of conversation was the history of open data, revolving its early years during Obama's admistration. The significance of open data was also discussed, as all panelists agreed that open data was the key to avoiding redundancy in research. But most importantly, the drawbacks of open data were illustrated through examples such as the Scala scandal. This was especially interesting because we often think of technology and data as a means to progression, but it's important to understand the care with which we should treat this data, else they can prove to be detrimental. 

I also planned to the **Talk Data To Me** event on March 7th. However, this event was rescheduled to April 5th, due to inclement weather.
