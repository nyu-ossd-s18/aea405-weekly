**Brackets Licensing**

Brackets is licensed under the MIT License, a permissive free software license that originates from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Under this license, persons are granted permission to deal in Brackets without restriction (which grants the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sellf copies of the Brackets documentation files) - essentially, the license puts only very limited restrictions on reuse. However, these rights only apply under the condition that a copyright notice is included in all copies or substantial portions of the Brackets files. 

**Team Progress**
The mockup of our plugin was completed and this week, I built the CSS/HTML code and pushed it to our repo. After that, all the UI stuff for the project has been completed/pushed and all we need now is the algorithm to pick the complementary colors. This week, we'll be working on our presentation.
