Our group has made the decision to attempt to create a plugin for Brackets - we think this will be a more challenging/interesting way to contribute to the community. As of now, our individual tasks are to come up with a 2-3 ideas for the plugin. My suggestions are:

- A plugin that allows the user to easily/intuitively change the font-color/background-color of the text editor 
- A plugin that lets the user draw a physical representation of a container and returns the dimensions of that container in pixels. 


**Questions for Donna:**
- What is the most meaningful thing you've done during your time as a software engineer?
- Do you find that the gender disproportion in the tech industry ever affects your work?
- Do you think tech giants *cough cought Facebook* are to be held responsible for the illegal breaches of their security/data?
