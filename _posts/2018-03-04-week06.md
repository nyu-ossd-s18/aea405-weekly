Our team has made the decision to work in the Brackets open source community. One of the strengths of our group is that we are familiar with the concept of using text editors, and so the Brackets community didn't feel so daunting to join. We have blocked off Tuesdays from 5pm - 7pm as a meeting time, and Thursdays 5-7pm for any extra time we might need. 

**Milestones for the project:**
1. Set up the coding environment 
2. Familiarize ourselves with the programming languages being used. 
3. Understand the labeling customs so we can began fixing code!
