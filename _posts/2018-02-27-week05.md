**What type of things are you looking for when you select an open source  project to work on?**

When I select an open source project, I am looking for something that interests me! I am looking for projects that either pertain to my life or something I can learn about that I've been meaning to. Additionally, I like to work on things that I'm already familiar with, if even slightly.  


**What are you able to offer to the team that you will be working on for the project - what are your strengths?**
I am able to code, so I am able to solve syntax related errors or even algortihmic ones. I'm also adept at UI related issues. 


**What are you hoping to learn from working on an open source project?**
I would like to learn the culture of open source development, some new coding languages, and be more proficient at using Github!


**What are you most worried about when you are thinking about and planning to work on an open source project?**
I'm basically scared of destroying a website by accident.
