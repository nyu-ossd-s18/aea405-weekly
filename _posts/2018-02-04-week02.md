**The Cathedral and The Bazaar**

The Cathedral method of software development involves the meticulous creation of software, characterized by care and serious consideration before release. Using this method, parts of the software are developed separately by those who are highly experienced in that individual aspect of the project. Basically, nothing's released until the product is perfect.

The Bazaar method, oppositely, involves a more care-free process. Anyone can work on any part of the project (are even, in fact, encouraged to), and ideas and approaches are flung around chaotically to produce a single functioning product. This product is released without the fuss of perfection, and instead is in a constant state of refinement - newer versions are released after former ones have been subjected to the changes of the development community. This is the version of develepmont that more closely resembles my style of work, and so is much more appealing to me.

1. *"Good programmers know what to write. Great ones know what to rewrite (and reuse)."* This is one of the first rules I learned as a programmer: don't write if you can rewrite. It saves time and effort, making you a better programmer. 

2. *"Smart data structures and dumb code works a lot better than the other way around."* It's much easier to fix bugs dealing with bad code than to attempt to fix a data structure that you don't understand.
